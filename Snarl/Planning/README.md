##Welcome to SNARL <br>
###Game Play Instructions <br>
- Run the local game using the command ./p8, adding any optional arguments if desired
- Once the game starts, enter a name to register yourself
    - our local demo currently only supports one user
- The game will render the user's surroundings (5x5) and its current position relative the level.
- The user must enter a coordinate for a move (row, col) to move
    - this coordinate must be relative to the level as well
    - the user will be given the same prompt and update if an invalid move is entered
    - to input a move, type the desired row then the col with no other non-numerical characters and a space between (ex. "2 1")
