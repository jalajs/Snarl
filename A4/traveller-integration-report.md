&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The engineers tasked with implementing our specification did so with thoroughness and great attention to detail. They established the two classes we asked for, Town and Character, with correct fields. The constructor for the Character only allows for the creation of a Character with a unique name, which is specific behavior we outlined. The constructor for Town also obeys the behavior we detailed and requires all Towns to have unique names and that no Town can be its own neighbor. Methods for placing a Character in a Town and querying an unoccupied path have also been defined. The entire .py file keeps track of an array of Towns and an array of Characters, which will allow for the game network to be stored and operated upon. Overall, this is a robust and detailed implementation of our specification. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integration between the received implementation and our client module would be possible with the use of a foreign function interface (FFI). However, an additional wrapper would be required in order to call the correct functions. This is due to a failure of our specification- we did not explicitly give function names. This has resulted in mismatched function names between our client and the implementation. Other than this, our client would be compatible with their implementation. We estimate integrating the implementation would take two hours, with the bulk of the time spent on researching FFIs and their application to java and python. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In thinking through the integration process and studying their implementation, we arrived on two items we would like to add to our next specification. First of all, we now see the importance of providing explicit function names in the specification. If we do not add explicit names, it is a given that we will need to create a wrapper when integrating as there is no way engineers will magically guess what we anticipated the name should be. We also admired how the engineers who implemented our specification included an array of Towns and Characters at the top level. If we were to write the specification for this game again, we would include an overarching Traveller object that contained an array of Towns and an array Characters. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, we commend the engineers who implemented our specification for paying attention to detail and following our guidelines precisely.
